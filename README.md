# RW_Realistic_Planets_1.3
NOTE: I (Windows XP) am not the original author of this mod. The original author is Rainbeau Flambe. He then stopped updating his mod so Saucy Pengiun did so. Then, 1.3 came out, Saucy Pengiun has not been active lately and the community (as well as myself) really really wanted to play the Realistic Planets mod so I took it upon myself to make it happen.

#Credits from the original about files:

Rainbeau Flambe, the original author of this mod. [Here is a link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1571623829)

Saucy Pengiun, the guy who updated this mod for 1.1 and 1.2. [Here is a link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2009542732)

The mod utilizes Pardeike's "Harmony Patch Library". For version 1.0, no additional download is required, as the library is included with the mod. For versions 1.1 and above, the separate Harmony mod is required.

The basic idea for the mod came from Steam user "Captain Lurmey," who was complaining to me one night about how he felt that RimWorld planets didn't look much like real planets.

Kiame Vivacity, for originally contributing compatibility for Faction Control in one of the earlier versions.
